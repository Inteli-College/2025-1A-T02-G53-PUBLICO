## 1. Introduction

Since February 2025, I have been developing the **Burnout Prevention Platform**, an innovative solution aimed at predicting and mitigating burnout in corporate environments, with a specific focus on the technology sector. This report marks the first of four public iterations, documenting the journey from the ideation phase to the validation of the proof of concept (POC).

The methods are presented in a way that does not expose proprietary details. Broad terms such as "psychometric assessments," "AI-based analysis," and "behavioral evaluations" are used to ensure that sensitive information—like specific details regarding data collection and AI configuration—remains confidential.

## 2. Project Ideation and Market Analysis

### 2.1 Problem and Market Opportunity

Burnout and stress are critical issues in the technology sector, where high demand and constant pressures negatively impact productivity and employee quality of life. Studies suggest that proactive interventions can reduce losses related to mental health and decrease costs due to turnover and medical care.

**Key Points Identified:**

- **Problem Identification:**  
  Challenges related to employee mental health result in significant productivity losses, increased turnover, and higher medical costs. Traditional approaches tend to react to problems once they emerge, rather than preventing them.

- **Market Opportunity:**  
  Market trends indicate robust demand for solutions that are both predictive and preventative in the realm of corporate health, particularly in remote or hybrid work environments. Early research and ideation underscore the opportunity to combine principles from neuropsychology and forensic psychology with modern AI techniques to create a differentiated platform.

- **Opportunities and Challenges:**  
  While there is significant market potential, challenges remain in ensuring data consistency, achieving user engagement with future surveys, and developing an AI capable of consistently suggesting improvements without disclosing sensitive details.

### 2.2 Conceptual Ideation and Research Base

During the ideation phase, I conducted extensive research, brainstorming sessions, and stakeholder interviews to define the core value proposition: a system that monitors well-being through user-friendly surveys combined with AI-based analyses, enabling the early detection of signs of burnout and stress.

- **Research Integration:**  
  The analysis of the *Mental Health in Tech Survey* provided valuable insights into leveraging existing survey data to test the method. This publicly available dataset was used exclusively for POC validation.

- **Initial Data Collection Proposal:**  
  Although the specific questions for the internal survey are still being refined, an initial draft has been developed to serve as the foundation for future data collection initiatives.

- **Product Value and Potential:**  
  Integrating psychometric data with an AI module that suggests adjustments creates a robust tool for anticipating burnout. Future plans include the incorporation of biometric data and sentiment analysis via NLP to further enhance the predictive capabilities.

### 2.3 Competitor Analysis

Market research identified the following competing solutions in the corporate well-being segment:
- **Microsoft Viva Insights:** Native integration with Microsoft 365 tools, but primarily reactive.
- **Zenklub:** Offers therapeutic support and personalized care, yet lacks a deep predictive component.
- **Headspace:** Focuses on mindfulness and validated methods, but does not integrate biometric data.
- **MeQuilibrium:** Utilizes AI to enhance employee resilience, though may lack specificity in early burnout detection.
- **Erudit:** Provides real-time insights with corporate tool integration, though there is room for greater personalization.

The competitive advantage of my solution lies in the integration of psychometric data with an AI module that adaptively suggests improvements to the method. Expanding to include sentiment analysis and biometric data will further enhance diagnostic accuracy and personalization.

### 2.4 Current Market Landscape

Recent studies indicate that:
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The global corporate well-being market is valued at approximately USD 51 billion.
- **Regional Context (SAM and SOM):** In Brazil and Latin America, the mental health solutions segment represents 10-15% of TAM, with the initial focus on medium and large technology companies.
- **Trends:** Increasing digitalization and remote/hybrid work drive demand for preventative solutions that comply with regulatory requirements (GDPR, LGPD) and ensure data security.
- **Regulation:** According to a recent article in Exame, mandatory actions related to mental health at work will be enforced starting in 2025, in line with the new NR 1 ([Exame, 2025](https://exame.com/carreira/saude-mental-no-trabalho-sera-obrigatoria-veja-o-que-muda-com-a-nova-nr-1-em-2025/)), creating a favorable environment for innovative solutions like this one.

## 3. Methodology and Approach

### 3.1 Data Collection and Analysis Strategy

The methodology is based on an established theoretical framework in psychology, combined with data analysis techniques and AI:

- **Use of Public Data:**  
  Initial tests use data from the *Mental Health in Tech Survey* to simulate the functioning of the predictive models, ensuring the approach is validated using a reliable, publicly accessible dataset.

- **Data Collection Structure:**  
  Although the specific survey questions are still in development, the draft proposes a structured approach combining daily check-ins with weekly assessments. This approach provides a balance between comprehensive data collection and minimizing participant burden.

### 3.2 The AI Module as a Dynamic "Judge"

A key innovative aspect of the method is the integration of an AI module designed to act as a dynamic "judge"—capable of suggesting consistent modifications to the survey questions based on user performance and feedback. For example, if the system detects a decrease in response consistency, it may suggest simplifying the wording or reordering questions. This functionality is described in general terms to safeguard proprietary logic.

### 3.3 Integration of Biometric Data and Sentiment Analysis via NLP

To enrich the analysis and offer a more comprehensive evaluation, future development plans include:

- **Biometric Data:**  
  Incorporating data from wearables to provide physiological metrics that complement the subjective data from surveys.
  
- **Sentiment Analysis with NLP:**  
  Applying NLP techniques to interpret open responses and assess the emotional tone, thereby deepening the analysis of the users’ emotional states.
