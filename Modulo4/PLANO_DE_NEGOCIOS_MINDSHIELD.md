## 2. Market Opportunity

### 2.1. Validated Problem

Occupational burnout has become a silent epidemic in the Brazilian technology sector, affecting **82% of professionals** according to recent research by DHR Global (2025). This critical scenario imposes significant financial costs on organizations: each employee replacement generates expenses between R$15-40 thousand when considering recruitment, onboarding, and productivity loss (SHRM 2024).

The urgency of this issue is amplified by the introduction of **Regulatory Norm NR-1 (2025)**, which establishes mandatory structured mental health policies in the corporate environment by May 2026. This regulatory milestone creates both compliance pressure and a commercial window of opportunity. However, the current market presents a critical gap: available solutions remain predominantly reactive, intervening only after severe symptoms manifest, while others lack scientific psychometric foundation or offer generic approaches incapable of distinguishing burnout from temporary stress.

### 2.2. Target Segment

The initial strategic focus concentrates on **Brazilian small and medium enterprises** (50-500 employees) operating in the technology and fintech sectors, geographically concentrated in the metropolitan regions of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. This segmentation results from careful analysis considering three factors: high burnout prevalence in these sectors, digital maturity facilitating SaaS solution adoption, and budget capacity compatible with preventive investments in organizational health.

The primary persona represents **Ana**, a People & Culture manager aged 32-42, responsible for HR teams in tech startups or fintech scale-ups with 80-250 employees. With budget authority in the range of R$50-200 thousand annually for people management tools, Ana faces the challenge of operating in reactive mode: identifying burnout cases only when employees request resignation or medical leave. Her central objective is to reduce current turnover from 18% to levels below 12%, recognizing that each prevented resignation represents direct savings between R$15-40 thousand. A crucial characteristic of this persona is the relatively agile decision cycle of 2-4 weeks, contrasting with enterprise corporate processes that often extend for quarters.

## 4. Business Model

### 4.1. Summary Canvas

The MindShield business model is structured as a B2B SaaS platform exclusively targeting **small and medium enterprises** in the technology and fintech sectors, with staff between 50-500 employees. The core proposition offers **preventive scientific burnout monitoring** based on the MBI-22 psychometric instrument, radically differentiating from generic or reactive approaches predominant in the current market.

The distribution strategy combines three complementary channels: outbound sales via LinkedIn Sales Navigator targeting HR managers, structured referral program encouraging organic recommendations, and strategic partnerships with HRIS system vendors (Gupy, Kenoby) enabling embedded distribution. Customer relationships prioritize **proactive customer success**, including quarterly business reviews (QBRs) demonstrating tangible ROI through prevented turnover metrics.

The revenue model establishes a fixed annual subscription of **R$25 per user monthly**, with a minimum contract of 50 users generating an initial ACV of R$15 thousand. Key resources sustaining value creation include the license and expertise in the MBI-22 instrument, scalable technological infrastructure on AWS, and specialized knowledge in applied psychometrics. Critical activities focus on continuous product development, consultative sales execution, customer success management, and rigorous regulatory compliance maintenance.

Strategic partnerships with **Occupational Health and Safety Services (SESMTs)** and specialized HR consultancies amplify commercial reach through referrals, while integrations with major HRIS vendors create alternative distribution channels. The cost structure deliberately remains lean, with a fixed baseline of R$2.8 thousand monthly covering cloud infrastructure, productivity tools, and legal advisory for compliance.

### 4.2. Revenue Structure

The pricing architecture reflects strategic positioning in the value-based spectrum, establishing **R$25 per user monthly** in annual contracts with upfront payment. This annual contractual model substantially reduces churn risk while improving operational cash flow predictability. The minimum threshold of 50 users (generating R$15 thousand ACV) aligns with the target customer profile while filtering leads incompatible with the business model.

The target ACV of R$30 thousand corresponds to the modal profile of a company with 100 employees, representing a sweet spot between budget accessibility for SMBs and unit economics viability. The margin structure projects **80% gross margin**, typical of SaaS models with variable costs predominantly concentrated in cloud infrastructure. Estimated variable costs of R$5 per user monthly primarily reflect scaling of computational capacity and storage as the user base expands.

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

### 5.1. Acquisition Channels (Year 1)

The market entry strategy prioritizes **outbound sales** as the dominant channel, responsible for 70% of qualified leads. Using LinkedIn Sales Navigator, the approach specifically targets HR managers and People & Culture directors in technology and fintech companies in the São Paulo metropolitan region. The contact cadence is structured in email sequences with 4-5 touchpoints distributed over two weeks, balancing commercial persistence with respect for the prospect's time. The operational goal establishes 20 monthly demonstrations, projecting a 15% conversion rate that would result in approximately 3 new clients monthly.

The second acquisition pillar, representing 20% of leads, is based on **referrals and organic network**. This strategy capitalizes on the INTELI ecosystem through alumni, former classmates, and specialized HR communities. To structure and incentivize this channel, a referral program is implemented offering one month of free service for both the current client and the newly referred client, creating bilateral incentive that amplifies viral effect.

The third strategic component, although smaller in volume (10% of leads), presents scalability potential through **strategic partnerships**. Two partner categories prove especially promising: SESMT consultancies (Specialized Occupational Medicine and Safety Services), which receive a 10% referral fee on closed contracts, and HRIS system vendors like Gupy and Kenoby, where technological integration enables embedded distribution of the solution within established people management flows.

### 5.2. Customer Success

The customer journey begins with **structured onboarding** designed for completion in less than one hour, including technical platform configuration and operational training of the HR team. This setup efficiency reduces adoption friction while demonstrating operational simplicity of the solution.

**Continuous engagement** materializes through weekly personalized emails presenting insights on aggregated burnout trends, transforming the platform from a passive tool into an active source of organizational intelligence. Quarterly, **Quality Business Reviews (QBRs)** are conducted presenting quantitative ROI analysis, specifically documenting prevented turnovers and associated financial savings. This tangible value evidence strengthens contract renewal and creates narrative for account expansion.

**Churn prevention** operates through an early warning system identifying disengagement signals, particularly significant drops in assessment completion rate. When these indicators are detected, proactive intervention by the Customer Success team is activated to investigate adoption barriers and implement corrections before dissatisfaction crystallizes into cancellation.

## 6. Financial Projections

### 6.1. Assumptions

The economic viability of the model is based on **favorable unit economics** validated through SaaS market benchmarks. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is projected between R$3-5 thousand per client, reflecting a relatively short sales cycle of 2-4 weeks characteristic of the SMB segment, with founder-led sales eliminating commercial team costs in the first year. This metric considers investments in prospecting tools, time dedicated to demonstrations, and marginal content marketing costs.

Lifetime Value (LTV) is estimated at **R$72 thousand**, calculated through average retention of 3 years multiplied by R$30 thousand ACV and 80% gross margin. This projection assumes an annual churn rate of 20% (approximately 1.7% monthly), aligned with B2B SaaS benchmarks targeting SMBs. The **LTV:CAC ratio of 14.4x** significantly exceeds the 3x threshold considered healthy by the industry, indicating substantial capital efficiency. The 2.5-month payback period demonstrates rapid investment recovery in acquisition, freeing capital for accelerated reinvestment in growth.

### 6.2. 6-Month Roadmap

| Metric | Month 1 | Month 3 | Month 6 | Target |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|------|
| **Pilot Clients** | 2 | 5 | 8 | 5+ |
| **Active Users** | 150 | 400 | 700 | 500+ |
| **MRR** | R$0 (trial) | R$2k | R$8k | R$5k+ |
| **Completion Rate** | 65% | 75% | 85% | >80% |
| **NPS** | N/A | 40+ | 50+ | >40 |

### 6.3. 3-Year Projection

| Year | Clients | Users | ARR | Costs | Profit |
|-----|----------|----------|-----|--------|-------|

- Growth: 2.3x/year (conservative for early-stage SaaS)
- Average ACV: R$30k (100 users/client)
- Gross margin: 80%
- Net margin: 52% (Year 3)
