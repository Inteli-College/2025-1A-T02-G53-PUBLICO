## 1. Introduction

Module 2 marks a pivotal transition from theoretical planning to practical execution within the MindShield project. This report provides a detailed account of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development, showcasing the tangible outcomes of this phase. The primary objective was to build a functional and secure platform capable of supporting the core functionalities of well-being monitoring. This includes the establishment of a robust technological infrastructure and the implementation of key user-facing features, setting the stage for real-world data collection and further analytical advancements.

## 2. Implemented Architecture and Core Components

The MindShield MVP is built upon a modern, layered architecture designed for scalability, security, and maintainability. The system is composed of a distinct frontend, a powerful backend API, and a flexible database layer, all integrated within a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

- **Frontend (User Interface):** Developed using **React** with **TypeScript**, the frontend provides an intuitive and responsive user experience. It consumes data from the backend API and renders dynamic content, including user dashboards, questionnaire forms, and activity history. Key libraries like **Vite** are used for fast development and optimized builds, and **Vitest** for robust testing.

- **Backend (API Services):** The core logic and data management are handled by a **FastAPI** application, written in **Python**. This backend exposes secure API endpoints for all platform functionalities. It utilizes **SQLModel** for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), facilitating efficient interaction with the database. The backend also incorporates advanced features such as rate limiting (**SlowAPI**) and comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.

- **Database:** The system is designed to be flexible, using **SQLite** for local development and testing environments, and **PostgreSQL** for production deployments. This ensures data persistence and scalability to handle growing user bases and data volumes. Database schema management is handled through **Alembic** migrations, ensuring version control and smooth updates.

- **Authentication System:** A robust authentication mechanism is implemented, supporting both traditional email/password logins and modern **Google OAuth 2.0** for single sign-on. Authentication tokens are securely managed using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, transmitted via HttpOnly and Secure cookies, enhancing user security and session management.

- **Infrastructure and Deployment (CI/CD):** The entire application is deployed on **Microsoft Azure**, leveraging its Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings for scalability and reliability. The deployment process is fully automated through **GitHub Actions**, enabling continuous integration and continuous delivery. This includes automated Docker image builds, pushing to Azure Container Registry (ACR), and deploying to Azure App Services (for the backend) and Azure Static Web Apps (for the frontend).

## 3. Key Features Implemented in the MVP

The MVP developed in Module 2 includes a comprehensive set of features essential for the MindShield platform's core functionality:

-   **User Authentication and Management:**
    *   **Registration:** New user sign-up with email and password.
    *   **Login:** Secure user authentication via email/password and seamless integration with Google OAuth.
    *   **Password Recovery:** Functionality for users to reset forgotten passwords.
    *   **Email Verification:** Ensures user email addresses are valid and active.
    *   **Session Management:** Secure handling of user sessions using JWTs and HttpOnly cookies.

-   **WHOQOL-BREF Questionnaire System:**
    *   **Dynamic Question Retrieval:** Frontend dynamically fetches active WHOQOL-BREF questions from the backend.
    *   **Interactive Form Completion:** Users can complete the questionnaire with auto-saving capabilities for responses.
    *   **Response Submission:** Secure submission of questionnaire responses to the backend.
    *   **Score Calculation:** Backend calculates domain-specific and overall well-being scores based on submitted responses. This includes the capability to integrate with Item Response Theory (IRT) parameters for more scientifically grounded assessments, if available in the database.

-   **Activity Tracking and History:**
    *   **Questionnaire History:** Users can view a history of their submitted questionnaires.
    *   **Form Availability Status:** Displays whether new forms are available for completion.
    *   **Previous Scores:** Access to past well-being scores for personal tracking.

-   **Reporting and Insights:**
    *   **Basic Reporting:** Provides initial visualizations of well-being trends and comparisons.
    *   **Interpretation and Suggestions:** Generates generalized interpretations of scores and provides actionable suggestions for well-being improvement. These interpretations are designed to be broadly applicable and do not reveal specific proprietary analytical methods.
    *   **PDF Report Generation:** The backend can dynamically generate PDF reports of analysis results, including charts and interpretations, for users to download.

-   **Dashboard and User Interface:**
    *   **Personalized Dashboard:** A central hub providing users with an overview of their well-being status and quick access to key features.
    *   **Dedicated Well-being Page:** A section offering a summary of well-being, general recommendations, and relevant resources.

-   **Company Code Management:**
    *   Implementation of a `CompanyCode` model and associated logic to manage unique codes for company registration, allowing for structured user onboarding within organizational contexts.

## 5. Challenges Encountered and Learnings

During the implementation of Module 2, several challenges were addressed, contributing significantly to the project's robustness and the team's learning:

-   **Adaptation of Data Collection Methodology:** A key learning involved the necessary adaptation of the planned data collection method. This adjustment, crucial for ensuring the scientific accuracy and practical relevance of the data, slightly extended the development timeline for the data collection phase, which has not yet formally commenced. However, the platform is now fully prepared to initiate this process, reflecting a refined approach to data acquisition.

-   **Frontend Deployment Challenges (Vite on Heroku):** Initially, there were significant difficulties in deploying the Vite-based frontend to Heroku, primarily due to complexities in handling environment variables during the build process. This led to a strategic decision to migrate the frontend deployment to Azure Static Web Apps, which provided a more streamlined and compatible environment for Vite applications, ensuring efficient CI/CD.

-   **Generalization of Sensitive Information:** A significant effort was dedicated to abstracting and generalizing proprietary details related to scientific methods and algorithms. This ensured that the public report clearly communicates the project's progress and the sophistication of its underlying mechanisms, such as the use of scientifically accurate and well-founded methods for analysis, without disclosing sensitive business intelligence or specific implementation details.

-   **Complex System Integration:** Integrating diverse components—including a Python backend, a React frontend, a PostgreSQL database, and Google OAuth—along with configuring a robust cloud infrastructure on Azure, presented intricate challenges. Overcoming these required meticulous attention to detail, rigorous testing, and a deep understanding of inter-system communication and security protocols.

-   **CI/CD Pipeline Optimization:** Establishing and refining the automated CI/CD pipelines on GitHub Actions for both frontend and backend deployments demanded careful configuration and troubleshooting. This process was vital for enabling efficient, continuous, and reliable software delivery.
