## 1. Introduction

Since February 2025, our project has focused on exploring innovative methods to improve corporate well-being through a combination of psychometric assessments, AI-based analysis, and behavioral evaluations. This report marks the first of four public iterations, documenting our journey from the ideation phase to the validation of the proof of concept (POC).

Our presentation of the methods is done in a way that does not expose proprietary details. Broad terms such as "psychometric assessments," "AI-based analysis," and "behavioral evaluations" are used to ensure that sensitive information—like specific details regarding the data collection methods and the AI configuration—remains confidential.

  Although the specific questions for the internal survey are still being refined, an initial draft has been developed. This draft will serve as the foundation for future data collection initiatives.

- **Product Value and Potential:**  
  The integration of psychological, biometric, and sentiment analysis data creates a robust tool for anticipating burnout. This approach, coupled with the use of AI to suggest adjustments in data collection instruments, differentiates our solution in the market.

### 2.3 Competitor Analysis

Market research identified the following competing solutions in the corporate well-being segment:
- **Microsoft Viva Insights:** Stands out with its native integration into Microsoft 365 tools, but it adopts a predominantly reactive approach.
- **Zenklub:** Emphasizes therapeutic support and personalized care without a deep predictive component.
- **Headspace:** Focused on mindfulness techniques and validated methods, yet it lacks biometric data integration.
- **MeQuilibrium:** Offers a robust solution for enhancing employee resilience through AI integration, although it may lack specificity in early burnout prevention.
- **Erudit:** Provides real-time insights with integration into corporate tools, though there is room for greater personalization of interventions.

The competitive advantage of our solution lies in the integration of psychometric data with an AI Module that has already been implemented, allowing for adaptive and personalized modifications to the method. In future phases, the expansion to include sentiment analysis and biometric data will further enhance diagnostic accuracy and alert personalization.

### 2.4 Current Market Landscape

Recent studies indicate that:
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The global corporate well-being market is valued at approximately USD 51 billion.
- **SAM and SOM:** In the regional context (Brazil and Latin America), the mental health solutions segment represents between 10% and 15% of the TAM, with the addressable segment (SOM) initially focused on medium and large companies.
- **Trends:** The rise of digitalization and remote/hybrid work increases the demand for preventative solutions, emphasizing the importance of approaches that adhere to regulatory requirements (GDPR, LGPD) and ensure data security.
- **Regulation and New Norms:** A recent article in Exame highlights the mandatory actions related to mental health at work starting in 2025, according to the new NR 1 ([Exame, 2025](https://exame.com/carreira/saude-mental-no-trabalho-sera-obrigatoria-veja-o-que-muda-com-a-nova-nr-1-em-2025/)). This regulatory change requires that companies adopt policies and practices that promote employee mental health, creating a favorable environment for the implementation of innovative solutions like ours.

## 3. Methodology and Approach

### 3.1 Data Collection and Analysis Strategy

The methodology is based on an established theoretical framework in psychology, combined with data analysis techniques and AI:

- **Use of Public Data:**  
  The initial tests use data from the *Mental Health in Tech Survey* to simulate the functioning of the predictive models, ensuring the approach is validated using a reliable, publicly accessible data source.

- **Data Collection Structure:**  
  Although the specific questions for the survey are still under development, the survey draft proposes a structured approach combining daily check-ins with weekly assessments. This ensures a balance between comprehensive data collection and minimizing the participant burden.

### 3.2 The AI Module as a Dynamic "Judge"

A key innovative aspect of our method is the integration of an AI module designed to act as a dynamic "judge"—capable of suggesting consistent modifications to the survey questions based on user performance and feedback. For example, the AI can recommend adjustments in the wording or order of the questions to maintain clarity and reliability. This functionality is described in broad terms without revealing the proprietary logic behind it.

### 3.3 Integration of Biometric Data and Sentiment Analysis via NLP
